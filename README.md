# Math Facts

## Overview

The Math Facts app quizzes kids on math facts and tracks progress.  Types of facts - addition, subtraction multiplication, etc. - and a few basic settings are selected before quizzing begins.  Facts that have been mastered (correct three times in a row) are not re-quizzed.  When a correct answer is given the app will show an animated green check mark.  If not correct, the correct answer will be shown.  A separate screen showing which facts have been mastered in a grid will be displayed.  Information about facts mastered will be saved for use over multiple sessions.
